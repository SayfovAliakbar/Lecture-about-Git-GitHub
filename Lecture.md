# What is Git?

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system 

designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools 

like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, 

and multiple workflows.

# Who is the maker of Git?

Git was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel. 

Git is used for version control in a huge number of software development projects, 

both commercial and open source.


# What is GitHub?

GitHub is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. It uses Git to 

provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, 

continuous integration, and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

It is commonly used to host open source software development projects. As of January 2023, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers

and more than 420 million repositories, including at least 28 million public repositories. It is the world's largest source code host 

as of June 2023. Over five billion developer contributions were made to more than 500 million open source projects in 2024.

# How Git work?

If you look at the picture, it becomes a little easier to understand. Each circle is a commit. The arrows show the direction from which commit the 

next one is made. For example C3 is made from C2, etc. All these commits are in a branch called main. This is the main branch, most often called 

master. The main* rectangle shows which commit we are currently in, in other words, a pointer.

# How make repository?

You are now ready to work with Git locally on your computer.

Let's create our first repository. To do this, go to your project folder.

Git now tracks changes to your project files. But, since you just created the repository, 

your code is not in it. To do this, you need to create a commit.

# What is repository?

A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, 

your files, and each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and 

can be either public or private.

Great. You've created your first repository and populated it with your first commit.
